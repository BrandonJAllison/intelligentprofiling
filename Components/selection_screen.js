        <Text style={styles.text}>Smart Talk (Intelligent Communication) is an aspirational way of communication.  One would generally believe that anyone who is concerned with their communication would want to communicate intelligently.  According to the Merriam-Webster definition of intelligent, this would mean to desire to communicate in a way that reveals or reflects good judgment or sound thought.  Whether in your professional communication or in personal interactions, this would seem to be a laudable goal.  It does not come, however, without some effort.  The problem is we generally donâ€™t want to put in the effort required.</Text>
